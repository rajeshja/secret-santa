# Secret Santa Generator

This is a simple client side app that allows organizers to map people to their Secret Santas. Secrecy is up to the organizers. 

Enter names of participants, add restrictions, and send the generated links to each participant. Only look at your own link! Save links for reference later, as you can't get the mapping back without the links.
